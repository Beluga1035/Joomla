## Introduction

Joomla is a widely-used content management system (CMS) that powers millions of websites. However, like any platform, it has vulnerabilities that can be exploited if not properly secured. This tool aims to help cybersecurity experts and ethical hackers test the security of Joomla servers.

By using this tool, you can identify weaknesses in Joomla installations and take steps to secure them. Remember, ethical hacking is about improving security, not causing harm.

## Features

- **Brute-force Attacks**: Automate login attempts to gain access to Joomla admin panels.
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**: Exploit vulnerabilities to read sensitive files on the server.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Test for XSS vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts.
- **Detection Capabilities**: Identify vulnerabilities in Joomla installations.
- **Python-based**: Easy to modify and extend for custom needs.

## Installation

To install the Joomla Exploit Tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Beluga1035/Joomla.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Joomla
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. You are now ready to use the tool!

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the tool. Here‚Äôs a simple guide on how to execute the main functions:

### Brute-force Login

To perform a brute-force attack, run the following command:

```bash
python brute_force.py --url http://target-joomla-site.com --username admin --passwords passwords.txt
```

### Local File Inclusion

To test for LFI vulnerabilities, use this command:

```bash
python lfi_exploit.py --url http://target-joomla-site.com --file /etc/passwd
```

### Cross-Site Scripting

To check for XSS vulnerabilities, execute:

```bash
python xss_test.py --url http://target-joomla-site.com --payload "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"
```

For detailed instructions on each function, refer to the documentation in the `docs` folder.
